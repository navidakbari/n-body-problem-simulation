# n-body problem simulation
In this project I simulate the solar system using n-body problem and you can extend it how much you can.

![sample](https://github.com/navidakbari123/n-body-problem-simulation/blob/master/project_photo.bmp)

## how it works?
For running the project clone or download the project source code and open it in Matlab program and run the **n_body.m** file.
